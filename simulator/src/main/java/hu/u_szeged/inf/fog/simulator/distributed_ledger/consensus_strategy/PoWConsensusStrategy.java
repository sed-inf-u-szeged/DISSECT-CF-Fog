     * adjusting the difficulty every {@code difficultyAdjustmentBlock} blocks based on
     * how long the last N blocks took to mine, compared to a target timespan.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p><b>Behavior:</b></p>
     * <ul>
     *   <li>If the ledger is empty, returns the {@code startDifficulty}.</li>
     *   <li>If the current chain length is not at a difficulty retarget boundary
     *       (i.e., not a multiple of {@code difficultyAdjustmentBlock}), the method
     *       returns the difficulty of the most recent block.</li>
     *   <li>Otherwise, calculates a new difficulty based on the time span between the
     *       oldest and newest blocks in the most recent window of {@code difficultyAdjustmentBlock} blocks.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p><b>Adjustment Formula:</b><br>
     * {@code newDifficulty = currentDifficulty * (expectedTimespan / actualTimespan)}</p>
     *
     * <p>If blocks were mined faster than the expected rate (i.e., {@code actualTimespan < expectedTimespan}),
     * the difficulty increases. If they were slower, the difficulty decreases. A minimum
     * difficulty of 1 is enforced.</p>
